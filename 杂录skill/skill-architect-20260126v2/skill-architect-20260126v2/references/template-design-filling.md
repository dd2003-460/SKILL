# Design Template - Filling Guide

## Current Context
- Briefly describe the existing system state
- Provide background for design decisions
- Keep it focused on what's relevant to this change
- Write in Chinese

## Requirements
- Distinguish functional (what to do) from non-functional (performance, security, etc.)
- Be specific and measurable where possible
- Avoid vague statements like "improve performance"
- Write in Chinese

## Design Decisions
- For each major decision, explain "why this way" and "why not that way"
- Show the thought process and trade-offs
- Document alternatives considered and rejected
- Write in Chinese

## Files Changed Section
- **This is the most critical section**
- Must explicitly list all files to be modified with line number ranges
- Format: `file_to_change_1.py (relevant snippet lines 23-49)`
- These should be the ONLY files impacted in this change
- Write descriptions in Chinese, keep file paths in English

## Implementation Plan
- Break down into clear phases
- Each phase should have concrete, actionable tasks
- Write in Chinese

## Optional Sections
- Only fill Testing, Observability, Security, Rollout sections if relevant to this change
- Leave sections blank if they don't apply (better than generic filler content)
- Write in Chinese

## Language Guidelines

- Use English for code blocks
