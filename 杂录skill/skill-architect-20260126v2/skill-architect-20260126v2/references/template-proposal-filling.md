- Use backticks for file paths (e.g., `path/to/file.py:123-145`)
- Write in Chinese, but keep file paths and technical terms in English

## Trade-offs
- Explicitly list pros and cons for each proposal
- Help the user make an informed decision
- Consider implementation complexity, maintainability, and risk
- Write in Chinese

## Validation
- Provide actionable verification methods
- Examples: unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks
- Write in Chinese

## Open Questions
